# Block 9: Unit 1 Career Simulation: Personal Website Pt I

# What are we trying to make?
You have been recently hired at FullStack Solutions as a junior developer. Your project manager, Calliope, sends you the following email to welcome you to the team and provide details on your first assignment. 

An email from calliope saying "Welcome to FullStack Solutions! We’re so happy you are joining our team.  I’m Calliope, your team’s project manager. Fullstack Solutions is currently competing for several different contracts to build web apps, including corporate websites, startup proofs-of-concept, and enhancements to some portals for our local government. As part of the process we are submitting brief bios and portfolios for each team member. Submit a Github link to your working repository in our ticket tracker before the end of the day, and let me know if you need any help or clarification!"

Calliope has asked you to create a personal site with a brief bio. It is a chance to show off who you are, what you are about, and what you have accomplished. We will focus on three main areas: the landing page, an about page, and a portfolio page.

You will get the chance to revisit this project as we learn new techniques, so do not worry about perfecting it during your first pass. The goal here is to practice writing semantic HTML, basic CSS, and Javascript. You must use a GitHub repository.

# Home Page
The landing page is your first impression. You can include a photo, your mission statement, and something which defines you. In our example, we have included a quote.

# About Page
An about page is a place for people to get to know you. You should include your interests, and things you are good at, and in general you should pull back enough of the curtain into your life to interest a potential employer in you as a person.

# Portfolio Page
The portfolio page is the meat and potatoes of your personal site, here you want to include the projects you have worked on. For each project you wish to showcase, you should include the name of your project, a brief description, a screenshot, and a link to where it lives on the web.

Note: You can use Lorem Ipsum for placeholder content, but it would be great if you included actual content.

There are three tabs below to help you stay organized as you work on this simulation.

## Criteria
1.  GitHub repository, with:
More than one branch (including main/master), with descriptive branch name(s)
More than one commit, with descriptive commit messages
A descriptive Readme file
2. A functional website that fulfills the requirements, and includes:
three pages: home, about, work/portfolio
A persistent header with links
Personalized content, including both formatted text and images
Basic CSS styling, included via an external file
3. A "Hello world" tier Javascript function, loaded via an external file
e.g., a console.log of a given string
4. HTML/CSS/JavaScript files submitted via a GitHub repository
